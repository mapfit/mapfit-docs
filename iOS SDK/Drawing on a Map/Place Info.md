# Place Info
To add a place info card to your map, you will need to define one or more of the informational components, such as title and description, of your location.

```swift
marker.title = "Artichoke Basille's Pizza & Brewery"
marker.subtitle1 = "111 Macdougal St (btwn Bleeker & W 3rd St)"
marker.subtitle2 = "Pizza, Italian"
```
